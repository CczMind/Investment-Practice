    "- In previous slides we can see that simple Python dataframes and libraries like Pandas can be used to perform basic backtesting of trading strategies. However using a specialized backtesting framework like `Backtrader` offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Abstraction of Complexity**: Backtrader abstracts away much of the complexity involved in backtesting. It provides a well-defined and structured framework that handles data loading, strategy execution, position management, order handling, and performance analysis. This allows you to focus on developing and testing trading strategies rather than building the infrastructure from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Efficiency and Performance**: Backtrader is designed to be efficient and optimized for speed, making it well-suited for backtesting strategies on large datasets. It is implemented in C++ with Python bindings, which can lead to faster execution compared to pure Python implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Modularity and Extensibility**: Backtrader's modular architecture allows you to mix and match components like data feeds, indicators, and analyzers to create complex trading systems easily. Additionally, you can develop and integrate custom indicators, analyzers, and data feeds, enhancing the flexibility of the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Built-in Technical Indicators**: Backtrader comes with a wide range of built-in technical indicators that you can readily use in your strategies. This saves you time from implementing these indicators yourself or relying on external libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Broker Integration**: Backtrader offers integration with various brokers, allowing you to test and deploy strategies with live data and real trading accounts. This feature is particularly useful if you wish to automate your strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Strategy Optimization**: The framework provides tools for strategy optimization, allowing you to test multiple parameter combinations efficiently. This helps in finding the best set of parameters for your trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",

It can handle various data formats, including CSV files, Pandas DataFrames, and live data streams from brokers. Data feeds are the foundation of backtesting, as they supply the historical price and volume data necessary for strategy testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cerebro**: Cerebro is the core of the Backtrader framework. It is the \"brain\" that coordinates the entire backtesting process. It manages the creation and execution of strategies, the handling of data feeds, broker integration (if applicable), and the generation of performance reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strategies**: Strategies are the heart of the backtesting framework. They represent the trading algorithms you develop to make buy/sell decisions based on historical data. You create a custom strategy by subclassing the Strategy class provided by Backtrader. Strategies generate buy/sell signals and manage positions and orders.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Observers**: Observers in Backtrader are components that allow you to track and record additional information during the backtesting process. They act as passive observers of the trading activity and do not directly impact the behavior of the strategy. Instead, they collect data and provide valuable insights into various aspects of the trading performance.\n",

    "- **Slippage** is a simulated deviation from the expected execution price. In real-world trading, the execution price of an order can be different from the market price at the time the order is placed due to various factors like market volatility, order book depth, and order execution speed. In Backtrader, you can simulate slippage by adjusting the execution price of your orders. For example, if you set a slippage of 0.01 (1%), it means that when you place a buy order at the current market price, Backtrader will execute the order at a price 1% higher than the current market price. Similarly, for sell orders, it will execute at a price 1% lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Commission** parameter in Backtrader is used to simulate transaction costs and fees associated with buying and selling assets in your trading strategy. It allows you to account for brokerage commissions, spreads, and other costs that are typically incurred in real-world trading. You can set the commission parameter when initializing the Backtrader broker object. The value you provide represents the cost of executing a trade as a percentage of the trade's value. For example, if you set commission=0.001, it means that the cost of executing a trade is 0.1% (one-tenth of a percent) of the trade's value."
